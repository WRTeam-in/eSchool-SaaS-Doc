# Change Item Animations

In the `lib/utils/constants.dart` file, to enable/disable item appearing animations, you can change the value of `isApplicationItemAnimationOn` to true/false according to your requirements.

To change the duration of animation you can adjust the milliseconds of different animations by increasing/decreasing the values of the duration variables.
