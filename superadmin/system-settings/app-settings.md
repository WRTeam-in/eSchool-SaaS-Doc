- App verison number must be in this 1.0.0+1 pattern. Some examples are 1.0.1+2, 1.1.0+15

- If force update is enable, in case of new update user will have to update the app and app will stop working. Super admin must add the ios and android app version before enabling the force update.

## How force update works?

If admin has enable the force update then it will compare with the app version from the super admin panel and user's installed app version. If the app version from super admin panel is gretaed then user's installed app version then it will open the dialog to update the app.
