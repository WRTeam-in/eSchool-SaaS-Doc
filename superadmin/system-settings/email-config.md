# Email Configuration

![e-School SaaS](../../static/images/superadmin/email-configuration.png)

- Email configuration will require some credentials of the SMTP, such as Mailer, Host, Port, Email Address, Encryption, Send From. Send From will be the same as the Email Address.

- Email Verification will be used to Verify the SMTP credentials whether credentials are correct or incorrect. If the Credentials are correct then testing email will be sent on your email. Otherwise it will give you an appropriate error.
